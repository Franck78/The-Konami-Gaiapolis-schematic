The board I have is really badly dead.

A lot of micro VIA are 'dead'. They are not complicated to fix.
Use a drill bit 0.3 0.4, thin wire.
The problem is fiding them.

Some traces may be missing, to/from the big QFP.

Also mostly ignored are jumpers because they need some desoldering 
to be sure of the connection. They are mainly under 36J/36M.

The GAÏAPOLIS board have some unpolutated footprints, I added some of them
with "NP".

Board ID is PWB353396A

You can help arraging it by recognizing 'patterns', net names.
