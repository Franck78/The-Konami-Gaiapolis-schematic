The board I have is really badly dead.

A lot of micro VIA are 'dead'. They are not complicated to fix.
The problem is fiding them.

Some traces may be missing, to/from the big QFP.

Also mostly ignored are jumpers because they need some desoldering 
to be sure of the connection.

The GAÏAPOLIS bnoard have some unpolutated footprint, I added some of them
with "NP"

Board ID is PWB353396A

This schematic is draft (01/2026)
You can help arraging it by recognizing 'patterns', net names.
